# If we don't disable the "OS prober" script, when we update the grub
# configuration, it may find OS installations that we don't want. For
# example, when updating grub from within the chroot environment, it may
# find the OS installed on the build server's disks, since we bind mount
# the host's /dev directory into the chroot environment. By disabling
# the "OS prober" script, we avoid this issue.
